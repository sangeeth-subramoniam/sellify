            <b>What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon collect?</b> <br>
            We collect your personal information in order to provide and continually improve our products and services. <br>

            <b>Here are the types of personal information we collect:</b> <br>

            Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you provide in relation to Amazon Services. See "Information You Give Us When You Use Amazon Services" under the "Examples of Information Collected" section further down the page to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our Amazon Services. If you provide us with a third party’s personal information, you will obtain consent from the third party regarding the provision.
            Automatic Information: We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of Amazon Services, including your interaction with content and services available through Amazon Services. Like many websites, we use "cookies" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon.co.jp on other websites. See "Automatic Information" under the "Examples of Information Collected" section further down the page to see examples of what we collect.
            Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily. See "Information From Other Sources" under the "Examples of Information Collected" section further down the page to see additional examples of the information we may receive.
            For What Purposes Does Amazon Use Your Personal Information?
            We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:
            <br>

            Purchase and delivery of products and services. We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.
            Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services. We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
            Recommendations and personalization. We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Amazon Services.
            Provide voice, image and camera services. When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our services. For more information about Alexa voice services, click here.
            Comply with legal obligations. In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we are required to collect health related information if you consult one of our pharmacists or registered salespersons regarding certain medications that we sell.
            Communicate with you. We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, e-mail, chat).
            Advertising. We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice.
            Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks. We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.
            What About Cookies and Other Identifiers? <br>
            To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice.
            <br>
            <b>Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?</b> <br>
            Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customer’s personal information to others. We share customer’s personal information only as described below: <br>

            <b>Our joint use:</b> We jointly use your personal information for such purposes as described in this Privacy Notice, with domestic and foreign subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc., controls, including Amazon.com Services LLC, Amazon.com Sales, Inc., Amazon Services International LLC, AMZN Mobile LLC and Amazon Japan G.K., that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. Amazon.com Services LLC, is the business operator primarily responsible for managing the jointly used personal data.
            Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. When you place an order from a third party, information related to the order will be provided to such third-party seller, including to sellers located outside of Japan, and such information will be subject to the third-party seller’s privacy policy. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer’s personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
            Third-Party Service Providers We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
            Business Transfers As we continue to develop our business, Amazon might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
            Protection of Amazon and Others We release account and other personal information when we determine release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, piracy protection and credit risk reduction. This also includes sharing safety-related information about products we sell, such as side effects of pharmaceuticals, to manufacturers and others as required by law.
            Other than as set out above, you will receive a notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
            <br>
            <b>How Secure is Information about Me?</b> <br>
            We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. <br>

            We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
            We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
            We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
            Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
            It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
            De-Identified Information
            De-Identified Information is information about individuals which we have processed such that a specific individual cannot be identified or the original personal information restored. We create De-Identified Information on a continuous basis that includes the following: Email Address, Name, Address, Customer ID, Order ID, Session ID.
            <br>
            
            <b>What About Advertising?</b> <br>
            Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and app. Third –party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest Based Ads Policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page.
            Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page.
            What Information Can I Access?
            You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the “Your Account” section of the website. See "Information You Can Access" under the "Examples of Information Collected" section further down the page for list of examples that you can access.

            <br><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b><br>
            If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Customer Service. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used.<br>

            As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.<br>
            You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in “What Information Can I Access?”. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.<br>
            If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. If you do not want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.<br>
            If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your "Advertising Preferences".<br>
            The help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Services that require you to sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our Cookie Notice.
            If you want to brows our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account and blocking cookies on your browser.
            You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in “Manage Your Content and Devices”), device, or application. For more information click here. Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device’s settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
            If you are seller, you can add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your Notification Preferences.
            If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the Author Portal and Author Central by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively.
            In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal data. If you wish to do any of these things, please visit here or contact Customer Service. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.<br>

            <b>Are children allowed to use Amazon Services?</b> <br>
            Amazon does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 20 years old, you may use Amazon Services only with involvement of a parent or legal guardian.

            Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions<br>
            If you choose to use Amazon Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of Japan. If you have any concern about privacy at Amazon, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to solve it.<br>

            Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our websites frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.<br>
